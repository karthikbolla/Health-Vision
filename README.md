# Health-Vision

**Health-Vision** is a medical image classification web application that uses deep learning models to classify medical images and provide diagnostic insights. The application is built using Flask for the backend, TensorFlow for model handling, and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- **Medical Image Upload**: Upload medical images for analysis.
- **Image Classification**: Models classify images into various diagnostic categories, like bone fractures, brain conditions, and more.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Elegant and modern UI with a glassy, user-friendly design.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instant classification results upon image upload.

```

## Models Used

Each model specializes in a specific diagnostic category:
- **All-in-One Model**: General model to classify broad categories of images.
- **Fracture Model**: Detects fractures in bone images.
- **Brain Model**: Classifies brain conditions (e.g., pituitary, glioma).
- **Chest Model**: Detects pneumonia in chest X-rays.
- **Eye Model**: Identifies eye conditions (e.g., glaucoma, cataract).
- **Kidney Model**: Detects kidney conditions (e.g., cyst, tumor).
- **Skin Model**: Classifies skin lesions and conditions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Narla-Venkata-Anand-Sai-Kumar/Health-Vision.git
cd Health-Vision
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- **Flask**: For the web application framework.
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and using the machine learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pillow**: For image handling in Python.

## Usage

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### Start the Flask Application

```bash
python app.py
```

### Access the Application

Open a web browser and go to:

```plaintext
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Upload and Classify an Image

1. On the homepage, upload a medical image (e.g., an X-ray).
2. Click the "Classify Image" button.
3. The application will process the image and display a classification result.

### Example Prediction Categories

After uploading an image, Health-Vision will classify the image into a category (e.g., "fractured," "pituitary tumor") depending on the model's result.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for serving the application.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning framework for loading and running models.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library for handling images.

### Potential Errors and Solutions

1. **Error loading model files**: Ensure all model files are placed in the `models/` directory.
2. **Environment compatibility issues**: Ensure Python and TensorFlow versions match the requirements.
